            <h3>Similarities</h3>
            <p>Indoor volleyball and Beach volleyball are very similar in many ways, however, these are just basic ways. They both have almost identical rules, gameplay, and style. The rules follow the same as the ball is served, there are only 3 thouches allowed, and when the ball touches the ground on your side of the court the opposing team is awarded a point. The gameplay is similar as in there is a backrow defender and a net defender, and the goal is to score points off of strategic shots. The team aspect is super important, skill levels need to be balanced, and the physical demand is also pretty equal. You must play a match to 25 and win by two, and then the sides are switched and the opposite team serves first. You might also wear similar clothing, and gear. The similarities will seem to be outweighed by the differences, but when you look at the general idea of the game of volleyball they are more alike than they seem</p>

        <section class="Differences">
            <h3>Differences</h3>
            <p>The differences between beach volleyball and indoor volleyball might seem miniscule because the games look similar with a ball being rallied across a court, but looks can be decieving. First lets note the obvious, there are 6 players on the court for a team in indoor, while only 2 on the team for beach, the court is much smaller on a beach court compared to indoor, one is played on a hard surface like wood and the other is soft like sand, and it might be a bit hard to tell from far away but the indoor volleyball is smaller and much heavier than a beach volleyball which is bigger and lighter. Aside from these more obvious differences you should also be aware that beach players must have a bit more well rounded skills than an indoor player. This is because since there are only two teammates on a team they must be able to both  pass, hit, set, serve, and defend well. Indoor players on the otherhand may be super good at defending and not so great at attacking, because they have more teammates that can cover those roles. This is an important aspect to think about because it does not make one sport easier or harder than the other, but it allows more opportunity. Next the conditions are different too. The natural elements are a factor in beach volleyball because it is outside, while indoor players only have to worry about the extra pipes and obstacles in a gym. As you can now see these sports are very complex in their differences, but they are equally as fun!</p>

        <h3>Which one should you try?</h3>
        <p>Now that we have covered some of the similarities and differences you can get an idea of what you want to experience. There is no bias answer coming from us but there are some factors to consider when deciding what version of the sport you are going to take on first. Some of these factors are group size, availability, skill level, and location. First your group size is huge because beach takes 4 people while indoor takes 12. If finding a group to play with is an issue beach might be the route for you because it is quick to play and you will develope many skills very fast. Next your skill level might be a problem, but not in the way that you think. If you wany to really enjoy your first experience playing with a bigger group might help you out more than a smaller group. With indoor volleyball you can rely and watch on others more, while beach on the otherhand you are an entire half of a team. While determining your skill level, if it needs some work you will probably enjoy indoor more to start. Finally, location matters as not everone live by a beach or has access to a sand court. This can very well determine whether you are going to start with beach or indoor. There are two links below that show an indoor volleyball game, and a beach volleyball game. Feel free to follow these links to give you a better idea of which you would like to try, or even just watch.</p>
