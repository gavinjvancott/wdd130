      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My website will be an informational website on beach volleyball and the AVP. The purpose of this site will be to inform people about a sport that is not as popular as the main sports kids are introduced to such as football, baseball, or soccer. The website will show how beach volleyball is a growing community, and explain opportunities such as the AVP, where beginners to professionals may compete in an open tournament.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will be aimed towards younger kids to young adults. These ages will range from 10-24.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will invite everyone to come and learn about volleyball. When this site is found all visitors will have their questions about volleyball answered. These questions might include: What is volleyball? Who can play volleyball? What are the basic rules to volleyball? How can I get started playing volleyball? Along with answering these questions the home page will explain that the purpose of this site is to invite people of all ages to play volleyball. Visitors will be able to browse our site and gain an understanding for what the sport has to offer, and it will give examples of what you need to have to get started. This site will be very user friendly and straight to the point unlike others that will be crowded with complex information. Everyone loves a website that is easy to understand and sticks to its point, and this home page will do just that.

      <h3>Indoor VS Beach</h3>
      <p>
        After people read the main page they will come to learn that volleyball has two main ways to be played, indoors and on the beach. This page will inform them of the similarities and differences between the game of indoor volleyball and beach volleyball. One question that should be answered here is which version of the sport to try. There are speific skillsets to each version that are important, and a lot of people tend to stick with one or the other rather than playing both. Visitors to this site will be able to not only learn the comparison of each version, but they will be able to follow links to videos of both sports to be able to visualize each sport in action. This will lead to a research filled day, and our site will be the kickstart.

      </ul>
      <h3>The AVP</h3>
      <p>
        The AVP page of this website will be for people that are leaning more into beach volleyball. Because beach volleyball takes less people to play it is often easier to start playing and learning skills here. This page is meant to show where you can take your game to compete at high levels. The visitor will be informed about the AVP, where it is played, who can play, and why this opportunity would be beneficial. There will be a list of popular beach volleyball players throughout the history of the event, and some of the achievments they have accomplished. The AVP can be participated in, but also just being able to go watch the event is super fun. This page will have links users can follow that will show event times, location, and even the past winners of the event along with videos of championship match replays. This will again help with the website's goal of informing more people about volleyball, and growing the community more than ever before.
