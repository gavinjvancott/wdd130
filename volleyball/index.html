            <h3>Volleyball Basics</h3>
            <p>Volleyball is an exciting team oriented sport that requires many different skillsets. Some of these skills are passing, jumping, setting, hitting, digging, and much more. The great thing about volleyball is that you can be an amazing player and teammate regardless of the size you are. There is a stereotype that all volleyball players are tall giants, but this simply is not true. There are 2 teams of 6 or 2 depending on the version you are playing, indoor or beach, and the sport is basically keeping the ball off the floor. There are front row and backrow players who all have specific jobs, and they all work together in order to be successful. Front row players mainly attack while backrow players will more often defend. Games are won by winning 3 out of 5 sets, and sets are played to 25 points and you must win by 2. The best way to play volleyball is to have fun. There is tons of fun in winning, but the overall competition of the game will create and amazing environment and friend group. Welcome to the volleyball community.</p>

            <h3>What to Wear</h3>
            <p>Volleyball, like most sports, requires athletic clothing. There are obviously higher levels to what you can specifically buy, but we will be very basic and to the point here. Starting from head to feet you might want a headband or visor to keep your hair or the sun out of your face. Next you can wear any type of polyester shirt, this helps to keep you cool while giving you the flexability you need in order to more around as necessary. Specific shirts might be long sleeve, shor sleeve, or tank tops, but wear whatever is most comfortable and to your liking. Now onto shorts, any gym shorts will work just fine, but if you can find some that go above the knee you will find them less restricting, and jump a bit higher. Then you might want to consider knee protection such as a brace or knee pads. Finally, the shoes you want are going to be a basketball shoe, but specifically on the lighter side. No matter what you wear as long as it is in this general range you will have a great time playing!</p>

            <h3>The Rules</h3>
            <p>There are a lot of rules to the game of volleyball, but we will just go over the basics to give you an idea of how the game is played. A game of volleyball begins with captians of each team meeting for a coin toss determining who serves first. The following set will begin with the opposite team serving frist and keep alternating from there. After the ball is served, the recieving team will have three contacts to return the ball back to the side that served, and the point will be given once the play is dead. Each team is allowed 3 touches, each team must stay on their side of the court divided by the net, and nobody may touch the net with any part of their body. One last rule to note about the net, is that on the right and left parts of the net there are antena, and if the ball is hit outside of or into these antena the ball is dead. When the ball touches the ground inside of the court on your side of the net the other team is awarded the point, and vice versa. The ball is allowed to hit the net, and if the ball is hit outside of the court lines the other team gets the point, unless the ball touches one of the opposing players before it lands outside of the lines. As mentioned before there are front row and back row players, and they have specific areas they cannot be. For example, backrow players cannot jump and attack the ball in front of the ten footline, a line that is 10 feet from the net on each side, but they can jump and attack the ball so much as they jump before that line. Finally, after each point the teams need to rotate clockwise at the start of the next play before the serve.</p>
